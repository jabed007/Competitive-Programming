# problem-solving
My codes for the problems I solved. The problems are mainly from URI, LightOJ, UVA, Codeforces, SPOJ etc.

Algo_DS_Implementation

It is the collection of all the Algorithms and Data Structures I learned throughout my entire problem solving career. Most of them are implemented by hand by myself. A few of them are taken from seniors/internet.
